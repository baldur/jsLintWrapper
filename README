LintWrapper
=================

jslint is awesome ... but how do you best incorporate it into your
environment? And how do you set it up so that your can gradually grow your
huge js library into a prettfied javascript that is totally "lint" free?


LintWrapper is an solution that we at patch.com are using to meet those
goals. Limitations are that it uses Rhino to run ... this means that you have
to have to load up your JVM to run it ... but it does do some caching so it
only checks files once and then rechecks them if there is a change.

java -jar lib/external/js.jar bin/linter

or better yet

make lint

then you can add configurations into the conf/settings.js file... this will be
modularized further into the development of this tool.


Any help or ideas are super welcome and appreciated.
