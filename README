h1. LintWrapper

jslint is awesome ... but what is the best way to incorporate it into your
development environment? And how do you set it up so that your can gradually 
grow your gigantic javascript library into a lintfree javascript. LintWrapper
is how we are attempting to lint the codebase for patch.com. And I would like
to extend this tool and see if any others out there have not found a suitable
jslint solution that works for large code bases.

h2. Here is the benefits of LintWrapper

* exclusion (such as libs that are not yours)
* forgiveness day ... only deal with files after a date
* ignore some js lint rules (idea snagged from jquery)
* caching ... no need to check a file that is unchanged

Limitations are that it uses Rhino to run ... this means that you have
to have to load up your JVM to run it ... but it does do some caching so it
only checks files once and then rechecks them if there is a change.

@java -jar lib/external/js.jar bin/linter@

or better yet

@make lint@

then you can add configurations into the conf/settings.js file... this will be
modularized further into the development of this tool.

Any help or ideas are super welcome and appreciated.
